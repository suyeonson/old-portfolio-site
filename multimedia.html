	<br>
	<p>During my one-year fellowship with the <a href="http://www.medilljusticeproject.org" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">Medill Justice Project</a>, I researched, compiled and verified the components of over 1,000 court cases involving a charge regarding <a href="http://www.medilljusticeproject.org/news-on-shaken-baby-syndrome/" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">Shaken-Baby Syndrome</a>, a condition the validity of which divides the medical community. <br><br>Characterized by a trifecta of symptoms that may indicate the child was a victim of violent shaking, SBS has been used as a legal tool of criminalization that some experts are now questioning. My research included speaking with national experts, tapping into existing databases in order to identify and outline the nuances of this largely unexplored issue of criminal justice. <br><br>The result was the launch of a <a href="http://www.medilljusticeproject.org/database/" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">database</a> on which MJP fellows and graduate students at the <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu" style="color: #00CCFF;" target="_blank">Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> collaborated to launch.<br><br> In the summer of 2013, MJP published <a href="http://www.medilljusticeproject.org/2013/08/27/the-gender-gap/" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">an article</a> that concluded males have been and are more likely to be accused of having violently shaken a baby. My contribution to the database was used as a basis for the report, and is credited at the bottom of the article.</p>

Michael, seen with his cane, was due for surgery because a metal screw holding his spine together came loose. "All pain passes," he said.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><em>In another life, I may have been a documentarian. In this life, I use a camera the size of my hand with a 20-minute battery life. What words can't capture, I try with video.</em><br><br>When asked to choose, Pate Conway calls himself an artist over an audiologist. He picks up maple seeds that have fallen onto the hood of his car, notices the painting mistake on a mailbox that has resulted in a colorblock and thrift shops for new patterns.
