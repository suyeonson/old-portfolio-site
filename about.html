<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; font-family: 'Crete Round', serif; font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 0;"><b>My name is Suyeon Son, also known as Summer,</b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; font-family: 'lato', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 0;">and I begrudingly gave up the Oxford comma in high school in my commitment to the AP Style. See a list of my experiences <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/suyeonson" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>
<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; font-family: 'lato', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 0;">I developed my passion for impactful journalism as a <a href="http://www.medillcherubs.org/2010/index.html" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">Medill Cherub</a>, when I learned about the Medill Justice Project. The director described how an incarcerated individual whom he helped exonerate with his reporting class had been released after two long decades. So long, in fact, that on his first car ride as a free man, the exoneree groped for the spinning handle to lower his window, and found that the current technologies had reduced it to nothing but a small square of a switch. Life had left him behind, and he had not deserved it.
<br><br>
Now, in an effort to recreate the kind of journalism that inspired me so many years ago, I write about <a href="http://www.chicago-bureau.org/1963-cps-boycott-reunion-holds-lessons-for-current-students-educators/" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">the continuing fight for equal access to education</a> in Chicago, anti-bullying policies that <a href="http://www.chicago-bureau.org/sidebar-anti-bullying-the-research-and-resources/" style="color: #00CCFF" target="_blank">just don't work</a> and <a href="writing.html" style="color: #00CCFF">other issues</a> of both local and national juvenile justice. 
<br><br>
Meanwhile, I look for new ways to develop my fluency with online technologies. In my appreciation of 21st century media as a hub of journalism, engineering and design, I seek to join the ever-increasing community of journo-techies. This website is a product of that curiosity.
